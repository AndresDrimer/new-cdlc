1) make session updates live, try movign everything to client side

2) how to deal with password for PDF? our goal is to avoid unauthorized persons to access our PDF, and prevent 
resgistered owner to have to ingress passowrd manuallty to open. ALso we need to check PDF viewer

I need to host a carpet of pdsf. Such a carpet should be non-public but yet, a registered user could see a pdf in browser by pressing a button. 
?? User may be able to download it or not?? - if he does it is going to end been uploaded for third parties , and became available for free

AWS3 would be a good choise?
Now it is locatted on Google Drive, but it is uploaded with a key , which is mandatory to see the pdf book
